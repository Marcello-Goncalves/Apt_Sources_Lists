# sources.list_files

A Collection of Linux Repositories Lists for the APT Package Manager that I Currently use for Installations.

### MIRRORS

As I'm Currently Based on Portugal, these sources.list files use mainly the [mirrors](https://ftp.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) from [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) of [Tecnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/)
