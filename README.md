# Apt Sources Lists

A Collection of Linux Repositories Lists for the [APT Package Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) that I Currently use for Installations.

### MIRRORS

As I'm Currently Based on Portugal, these 'sources.list' files use mainly the [Mirrors](https://ftp.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) from [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://dei.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) of [Tecnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).

### DEBIAN

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Stable is the Distribution that I "Gravitate" towards when installing Linux on a Machine that i would depend on.<br>
As its name Suggests, The development of Debian's stable releases focuses on Building the most "Solid" System for Production use.

The Mirrors included in the [File](https://github.com/Marcello-Goncalves/Apt_Sources_Lists/blob/main/Debian_Bullseye_sources.list_ULISBOA) use the mirrors from [ULisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/) since they showed to be the Fastest to be fetched based on my Location.<br>
However I've Included other Mirrors that showed to have High Downloading Speeds (Again, Varies Based on Geographical Location.) <br>As well as the Mirrors found on the Original Installation Media.<br> 

The Package [Sources](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) Included are From:<br>
- [Main](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-main) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-&ensp;[DFSG-compliant](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) software. These are the only packages considered part of the Debian distribution.
- [Contrib](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-contrib) &emsp;&emsp;-&ensp;Contains DFSG-compliant software, but have dependencies not in 'Main'.
- [Non-Free](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-non-free) &emsp;-&ensp;Contains software that does not comply with the DFSG. (e.g. Prorietary Drivers For Specific Hardware Components).<br>
